A blockers visualisation board

Hack day at the office. Don't judge the quality of the code(just a few hours to do something valuable).
The purpose of this prototype is to encourage the building of a mechanism blockers visualisation. Often IT departments
are composed of many teams each with a different manager, diferent priorities, etc... But at the same those teams are 
interdependant very often. By raising awareness on the blockers accross the department, we can get help raise the feeling
of share responsibility that agile encourages. 

This app will calculate the average time to unblock a blocker, and will sumarize the times each of the blockers toke to 
unblock.
